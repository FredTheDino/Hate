	 *
	 * In the audio thread, set every
	 * audiocomponent everyframe. This makes
	 * it less messy to send in new information
	 * and stuff. 
	 *
	 * Translate audio from "local audio space", to
	 * "global audio space" with a variable.
	 *
	 * The sounds are sorted into groups,
	 * for music and for sound effects
	 * so the engine can tell them appart.
	 *
	 * We store all audio events in a que
	 * that is then processed in the same 
	 * order in the other thread.
	 *
	 * You can also get a refference to 
	 * a source from the thread, not sure
	 * how to do this yet, which can be
	 * used to make things fade, change volume,
	 * pause or what ever.
	 *
	 * I also need to write the wav loader,
	 * and make sure it works.
