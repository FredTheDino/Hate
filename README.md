# Hate - A passionate desire
A simple game engine in C++.

## What I want this to be
I want this to be a game engine that is focused more on usability and getting out of your face.
That is why this engine is ment to be mainly written in a procedural/functional style, where 
a thought can be condensed into a single procedure call. But I don't want to limit myself
to it since some constructs are better made with Object Orientation.

To top it off, I want to make a "behaviour" system, a system that lets your define game behaviours
through a visual programming language which allows fast itteration and rapid prototyping. 

But be warned, this is aimed to be a simple little game library or "engine" if you want to be technical.

## What is it built with?
The library is using OpenGL with GLEW, GLFW, and OpenAL Soft. The lastter is 
compiled with the engine, so that should not keep you up at night. And I try 
to keep dependancies to a minimum to make it as portable and flexible ass 
possible. Other dependenies are included in the source code, but these are 
the external ones.

## How is this made?
I make games, and try to single out the properties I want to use when I make and 
think about games. So it's kept as simple as possible.
