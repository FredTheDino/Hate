# Hate
A simple game engine in C++
It is entiy driven and is as lightweight as it can be.

Using OpenGL and GLFW it is truly cross platform.

The "gimmic" with this engine, is to make a behaviour
system, like the one in present in a cirtain game series.
This is to allow rapid prototyping and accessability
for people who, can't/aren't interested or doesn't want to code.

## Who neads markdown?
The file TODO, has stuff in it that I want done, it currently
has more information than this so look there if you want to
see what I'm working on.
